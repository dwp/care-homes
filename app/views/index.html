    <!-- <h3>Problem Statement- </h3>
    <p>DWP are not always made aware when a citizen is admitted to or leaves residential care. Nor are we typically made aware when the circumstances of their stay change.
    Often, DWP hears about these changes to a citizen’s circumstances only after a significant delay.
Citizens are expected to notify DWP of any changes of circumstance. However, given the situation someone in residential care faces, they might struggle to do so.</p><p>
This situation means that vulnerable citizens do not receive the payments they should, leaving them building up debt from overpayments or left without income they need.</p>
